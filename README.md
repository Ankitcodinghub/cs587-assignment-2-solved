ÔÇß Deliverable: post your homework on Blackboard digital dropbox as a single zipped file with the name ‚ÄúHW2- YourLastName, FirstName‚Äù.

ÔÇß Include the following files in your compressed/zipped (winzip only) file for your assignment #2 submission:

1. Assignment#1 ‚Äì MS-project file

2. Assignment#2 ‚Äì MS-project file

3. Analysis.pdf file

Use the data spreadsheet provided below to achieve the following:

1. Assume it has been requested that this project be started on

3/8/21 after the project in Assignment#1 has been started on 2/22/21. This project and the project in Homework#1 will use/share the same resources listed in Assignment#1.

2. Create a resource pool in MS-Project that will be shared by Homework#1 and Homework#2

3. Feed the information provided in this handout in MS Project to create the Project Plan and the Network Diagram

4. Create a WBS with the required phases and activities to complete this project

5. Assign the Resources to the Tasks making any assumptions you consider appropriate (Software Engineering Assumptions).

8. Submit your MS Project Files

9. Submit your Comments regarding the start and completion dates and resources assignments for the two projects in a PDF document called Analysis.pdf.

10. The documents in step 8 and 9 shall be saved in a zipped file with name ‚ÄúHW#2- YourLastName, FirstName‚Äù.

Resources Available

Important Note: Use the same resources listed in Assignment#1; in essence, Assignment#1 project and Assignment#2 project will share the same resource pool. ONLY assign the needed resources to the tasks; for example writing project plan needs one manager of the available managers, however, you could use all available requirement engineers to work on writing the requirements.

In addition to resources listed in Assignment #1, following resources have been added to the resource pool of available headcounts

1. The following project managers are available: PM4, PM5, PM7

2. The following requirement engineers are available: RE28, RE29, RE32

3. The following system engineers are available: SE30, SE31, SE32, SE35

4. The following programmers/software engineers are available: PE58, PE59, PE65, PE66

5. The following test engineers are available: TE71, TE72, TE73, TE74

6. The following Documentation engineers are available: DE81, DE82,

DE84, DE85, DE91

Assumptions and Constraints:

1. Every review or inspection ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù task shall be carried by 5 engineers including ONE of the author(s)

2. Every review or inspection ‚Äúpreparation‚Äù task shall be carried by 4 engineers excluding the author(s)

3. Any ‚ÄúRework‚Äù task can be executed by one or all authors of the original task

4. Project Plan shall be reviewed by at least one engineer from every technical area.

5. Data Model can be created only by system engineers and can be reviewed by any engineer

Task/Activity Dependencies:

It is expected that you will find the correct task dependencies based on the material discussed during class and considering the following constraints:

1. There is no technical task prior to requirement phase; project planning is not a technical task it is a managerial task.

2. Analysis Activity can start as soon as requirement document is complete

3. Design activity can start as soon as Analysis document is complete

4. Coding can start as soon as design is complete

5. Writing Test Plan can start as soon as requirements are complete

6. Executing Test Plan can start as soon as coding is complete

7. Documentation can start as soon as requirements are complete

8. Any other constraints that you might add, shall be documented clearly when you submit your homework.

9. Lab and Environment Setup Tasks must be completed before Coding tasks or text case execution tasks can be started.
